# Rooster Grin Take Home - Build a Widget

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to write a simple little widget.   
This widget needs to be deployable as a snippet of code to many different websites that you do not have access to.    
You'll find the snippet just above the closing `</body>` tag of the index.html file.

### This widget does two things:

1. Renders a small call-to-action button in the bottom left hand corner of the screen reading 'click me!'.
2. When the button is clicked, it disappears and a div/modal is rendered on top of the existing website in the center of the page. Feel free to add pictures and/or text to the modal as you see fit.

### Things to think about:

* **Do not** edit the index.html file directly; however, feel free to change it programmatically from `widget.js`.
* Make certain the code you write in `widget.js` won't conflict with any code that may be written on the site.
* Feel free to use jQuery but don't assume it's already loaded on the target website. In the case of this assignment, it's not.
* You're welcome to add a stylesheet to style your widget and modal but remember, do not edit `index.html` directly.

This assignment is open ended. Feel free to go beyond the requirements listed but take no longer than 3 hours to complete it.
